# How to connect your Neon Database to your Express server

---

## Get your Neon database's Connection String

1. Get your Neon database's Connection string. To do this, go to the Neon.tech website and open up your Neon project. You should see a 'Connect to your database' section where you can click on the Connect button.

2. Once you click on the Connect button, you should see a window pop up with your database's Connection String, which contains the password/access credentials to your database.

    Make sure the Connection string starts with `postgresql://` â€” if it doesn't, you'll need to click on the dropdown menu to the upper left of the Connection String and make sure you have `Connection String` selected, and not something else like `psql`.

5. Copy your database's Connection string by clicking on the `Copy snippet` button. This connection string contains the secret key needed to access your database. 

## Paste your database's Connection String into your server's `config.js` file
1. In the `src` folder in the `server` folder, locate the file called `config.js`. 
2. Replace the value of the `databaseUrl` property  with your Connection String. Make sure it has quotation marks around it so that it's a String:

3. Now your Neon database should be connected to your Express server!
