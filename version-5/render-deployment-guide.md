# Deploying to a Remote Database/Server on Render


## Introduction

There are many options for deploying your application to a remote database/server. The purpose of using one of these cloud hosting platforms is so that we, as developers, don‚Äôt have to worry about things like maintaining physical servers, configuring them, making sure they don‚Äôt overheat, etc.

---

## Why are we using [Render](https://render.com/)? What are the other options?

**Beginner-Friendly Options**

1. **Render** ‚Äì Free-tier available, easy deployment with GitHub integration, supports Node.js and PostgreSQL. This is the one we will use!
2. **Railway.app** ‚Äì Managed hosting with automatic database provisioning, straightforward setup.
3. **Heroku** ‚Äì Classic PaaS, easy Git-based deployment, free-tier available but limited.

**Intermediate Options (More Control)**

1. **DigitalOcean App Platform** ‚Äì PaaS that simplifies deployment while offering more customization.
2. **Fly.io** ‚Äì Deploy full-stack applications globally with minimal configuration.
3. **Vercel (with external DB)** ‚Äì Best for front-end but can host Node.js backends with PostgreSQL elsewhere.

**Advanced Options (Full Control Over Servers)**

1. **DigitalOcean / Linode / Vultr (with Docker)** ‚Äì More hands-on, you will learn server setup, Docker, and database management.
2. **AWS EC2 + RDS** ‚Äì Best for learning cloud deployment at scale, but has a steeper learning curve.
    1. Or! You can look at deploying to AWS with Serverless.
3. **Google Cloud Run** ‚Äì Serverless, good for auto-scaling APIs with PostgreSQL on Cloud SQL.

## What are the steps we are going to take?

| **Step** | **Why?** |
| --- | --- |
| 1: Create a Render Account | We will be deploying code and our database on Render‚Äôs servers so that our website can be accessible over the internet. Render will handle keeping our code running as well as the directing of HTTP requests to our code. |
| 2: Creating a Web Server | We will spin up a server that will host our backend (server) code. We will connect this server to our Github repo storing our Node repo so that when we push code updates, it will automatically update our server! |
| 3: Adding a Database Server | We will create a database server that will host our database remotely. We will use our SQL commands to create our tables, and we will get the new database/host information to update our config data. |
| 4: Connecting to the Remote Database on pgAdmin | We will use pgAdmin to connect to our remote Database server. This is exactly like the process for connecting to our local database, but instead of localhost as our host, we will use the URL created by Render |
| 5: Updating our Web Server | We will need to add our database config to environment variables so that stay secure (and aren‚Äôt added to our Github repo) |
| 6: Updating our Frontend code | We will need to update our API calls to make requests to our Render URL instead of localhost, then we can deploy our FE to Netlify! |

## Step 1: Create a Render account

We will be using Render to create a database that will be hosted on a server. Render is a cloud computing platform that allows you to deploy your applications to the web.

- Go to [https://dashboard.render.com/billing#plan](https://dashboard.render.com/billing#plan) to sign up. You can use your email or connect your Github to sign up.
- Enter information about your profile, and then select Hobbyist as the plan.


> üéØ 
> Step 1 complete: Now you should have a Render account! 

---

## Step 2: Creating a Web Server

We will create a web service that will host our Node code.

- Click on the Web Server option in main dashboard
- Link your Github repo with the countries_api project
- Click on Create a Project, give it a name (‚ÄúCountries Project‚Äù)
- Root Directory should have the file path to your `src` directory that contains your server‚Äôs `index.js` file
- Build Command should be `npm install`
- Start Command should be `node index.js`, which is the same command we use to run our server locally

[](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd9pECAhWqmVjv13TQqJIGzDcwywm9nj9SQBmWGnbmaW_G3TCx1ngu-X0VDPmIV5Iiefcl0vPjjCD104ui5Bn3EgecT60rE7qeSJOP1phq7rexAcw9Heh_NsNhMgOsqoizGFB-fcA?key=9je8baAxEYwQkPyIstTxIMhU)

- Select the Free option and start the deployment

> üéØ
> Step 2 complete: Now your server should be fully deployed on Render! 

---

## Step 3: Adding a Database Server

We will create a Postgres database in order to host our data on a server.

- Click on ‚ÄúNew Postgres Database‚Äù in the top right corner.
    
    [](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeKOKoz_ci_eV-1QTn05oonFA1J01Ulkj21H-u6cW0FfeByWbPif23DTIolE9tRpbA0qr5Z1ZMqSXP66IiXx6zJh1nhe2g5aoAq5chOuuYP1aerKAT-KcsxEvO2FMZFKznXWwnhZA?key=9je8baAxEYwQkPyIstTxIMhU)
    
- Then click on ‚ÄúPostgres‚Äù in the left sidebar.

[](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeKS61b9tcnjQJhsh5D26UoS8qh5SVg38AefmYEVNMfGMVAs5ZRWUwWLPU64qG7xQcEwKarH9DiMS5Vj3MOjcK6uW0kx8hH12bUP8IdWN2zb2PbpQ4R82woH6UMccSxmipIVe836A?key=9je8baAxEYwQkPyIstTxIMhU)

- Add a name (`countries_api_project_database`), select Free, and click Create Database.

> üéØ Step 3 complete: Now you have an empty remote database that is deployed on Render! 

---

## Step 4: Connecting to the Remote Database on pgAdmin

- Now that you have deployed your database remotely on Render, the next step is to connect to it on pgAdmin. That way, we can manage the remote database by creating tables and inserting rows of data.
- In Render, open your database server and select Info in the left sidebar. Scroll down to the Connections section, which contains all of the info needed to connect to this remote database:
    
    ![image.png](Deploying%20to%20a%20Remote%20Database%20Server%20on%20Render%201d5bb7044bb18058b787fc258f37e764/image.png)
    
- Next, open pgAdmin.
- In the left sidebar, right click on Servers (or Server Groups) and click Register Server

![image.png](Deploying%20to%20a%20Remote%20Database%20Server%20on%20Render%201d5bb7044bb18058b787fc258f37e764/image%201.png)

- We will now need to enter the information to connect to our database server.
    - Under the General tab, for the Name of the server, use `countries_project_on_render`.
        
        ![image.png](Deploying%20to%20a%20Remote%20Database%20Server%20on%20Render%201d5bb7044bb18058b787fc258f37e764/image%202.png)
        
    - Switch to the **Connection** tab.
        - For the ****Hostname/address, you will do the following:
            - Copy the External Database URL from your database server‚Äôs Connections page on Render.
            - You will need to remove the first part of the URL before the `@` sign as well as the file path at the end.
            - For example, let‚Äôs say the copied URL from Render looks like this: `postgres://countries_project_user:HMoP9Guq0Y53ieEeccuDj453ybRNc4w7@dpg-clnlpe4g7mts73a6t65g-a.oregon-postgres.render.com/countries_project`.
            - You will only use what is *after* the `@` sign, and remove what is *after* the `/`.
            - So, your final URL should look like `dpg-clnlpe4g7mts73a6t65g-a.oregon-postgres.render.com`
        - For the Username field, enter `countries_project_user`.
        - For the Password field, copy the password and add that to pgAdmin.
        - Toggle on the "Save Password?" button.
            
            ![image.png](Deploying%20to%20a%20Remote%20Database%20Server%20on%20Render%201d5bb7044bb18058b787fc258f37e764/image%203.png)
            
    - Click Save. Now you‚Äôve created your new Server on pgAdmin! This new Server is what will connect to your remote database that you deployed on Render.
- In the left sidebar on pgAdmin, located your new Server called `countries_project_on_render`.
    - Click on the Server > Databases > `your database` > Schemas > public > Tables.
        - We haven‚Äôt added any tables yet, so you won‚Äôt see anything under Tables yet. But now our connection between pgAdmin and our remote database is ready to go.
- Create your tables in your new server
    - In your new server, open the Query tool
    - Run all of your `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT INTO` commands which you should have already documented in your `database_schema.sql` file


> üéØ Step 4 complete: We have successfully created a database that is running remotely on a server, AND we have connected to that database securely using pgAdmin!

---

## Step 5: Updating our Web Server Code and Environment Variables

- **Create a version-5 folder:**
    - In your Countries API project directory on VS Code, duplicate your server folder and name the copied folder ‚Äúserver-local‚Äù. This folder will hold the code for the server that you run locally with your version-4.
- **Configure our remote server:**
    - We will update the server configuration so that it works with our remote server that we are deploying to Render.
    - In the `index.js` file, which is located in the server/src directory, add the following JS object after the import statements:
        
        ```jsx
        let config = {
        	user: process.env.USER,
        	host: process.env.HOST,
        	database: process.env.DATABASE,
        	password: process.env.PASSWORD,
        	port: process.env.DATABASE_PORT,
        	ssl: true
        };
        ```
        
- Now your index.js file in your server folder should look something like this:

![image.png](Deploying%20to%20a%20Remote%20Database%20Server%20on%20Render%201d5bb7044bb18058b787fc258f37e764/image%204.png)

- **Delete the `config.js` file**, which is located in the server/src directory.
    - Originally you created the `config.js` file to connect to your *local* database in Version 4.
    - However, in Version 5, you no longer need `config.js` because your code is no longer connecting to the *local* database. Instead, you will connect to your *remote* database deployed on Render using the `config` object you just created in the `index.js` file.
- **Add, Commit, and Push to your updated code to Github**
    - Pushing to Github should trigger a re-deployment of our updated server code, which is super neat!
- **Add Environment Variables in Render Console**
    - In your Render Console for your remote server, go to the Environment section and add the values to the 5 environment variables. It should look something like this:
    
    ![image.png](Deploying%20to%20a%20Remote%20Database%20Server%20on%20Render%201d5bb7044bb18058b787fc258f37e764/image%205.png)
    
- Click Save, Rebuild, and Deploy
- Commit your code so that it pushes to Github (and redeploys to the server instance).
- Now that your web server is running, if you have any console.log() calls in your index.js file, those will show up in the Logs section because this is deployed remotely. It‚Äôs not going to show up in the terminal anymore, because we‚Äôre no longer running our server on our local machine.


> üéØ Step 5 complete: Now your web server can talk to your database server, both of which you deployed remotely to Render! 

---

## Step 6: Updating our Frontend Code

- **Create a version-5 folder** in your repo by duplicating your version-4 folder and renaming it.
- **Find your API‚Äôs URL in Render**
In your Countries API web service in Render, you should see a URL that looks like this: [https://countries-api-vn58.onrender.com](https://countries-api-vn58.onrender.com/)
    - You can find yours on the main tab under Settings or Events
    - This is the URL of our remote server. It‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to use to point all of our API endpoints.
    - This URL should replace localhost:3000 in your frontend fetch queries to send your GET or POST requests.
    - For example, if our frontend is trying to make a request, such as getting all saved countries, the URL would look something like `https://countries-api-vn58.onrender.com/get-all-saved-countries`
- **Update `vite.config.js` file**
We also need to make sure our CORs is set up properly. In your `vite.config.js` file, be sure that you have added the URL for the Render server
    - **Be sure that the target key reflects your correct URL from Render**
    
    ```jsx
    // vite.config.js
    import { defineConfig } from "vite";
    import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
    
    // https://vite.dev/config/
    export default defineConfig({
      server: {
        proxy: {
          "/api": {
            target: "[https://countries-api-vn58.onrender.com](https://countries-api-vn58.onrender.com/)/",
            changeOrigin: true,
            secure: false,
            rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, ""),
          },
        },
      },
      plugins: [react()],
    });
    
    ```
    
- **Add a `_redirects` file in the `public` folder** of your frontend `version-5` folder. It will have the following content:
    - **Make sure the URL reflects your correct URL of your API deployed on Render**
        
        ```
        /api/* https://countries-api-vn58.onrender.com/:splat 200
        /\* /index.html 404
        /* /index.html 200
        ```
        
    - Here is an example of what that file will look like on VS Code. It might throw errors on VS Code but that is okay. Just make sure you‚Äôve changed the URL.
        
        ![image.png](Deploying%20to%20a%20Remote%20Database%20Server%20on%20Render%201d5bb7044bb18058b787fc258f37e764/image%206.png)
        


> üéØ Step 6 complete: Now your `version-5` folder, which contains all of the frontend code, should be able to connect to your remote web server that you deployed on Render! 

---

## Step 7: Deploy Frontend to Netlify

- In your Netlify account, deploy your `version-5` folder. [Refer to this guide if you need help with this.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18jxCUA0bebCyYaIHy8aaKMgOQH4w5-b-iCGDWpV4K4M/edit?tab=t.jnwta4jrhylr#heading=h.scmsi7a6s9yz)
- Open the Netlify deployment link in the browser.
- Test your application by going to its Netlify deployment link. If it‚Äôs all working, then as you interact with your `version-5` site, you should see data show up in your tables on pgAdmin.

> üéØ Step 7 complete: YAY! You‚Äôve deployed your frontend! 

---

## Step 8: Test your full-stack application

- So at this point you‚Äôve‚Ä¶
    - deployed your frontend `version-5` folder to Netlify
    - deployed your backend PostgreSQL database to Render, connected to it on pgAdmin, and created your tables on pgAdmin
    - deployed your backend API to Render
- So now it‚Äôs time to test! Go to your Netlify deployment link in the browser. Test your site by doing the following:
    - Submit to the form.
        - Does that form data show up in the users table on pgAdmin? Does the ‚ÄúWelcome, {user}!‚Äù on the Saved Countries page welcome our new user?
    - Save a country.
        - Does that country show up on the Saved Countries page?
        - Does that newly saved country show up in the tables on pgAdmin?
    - Check a country‚Äôs view count.
        - Each time you open a country‚Äôs CountryDetail page, do you see its view count go up by 1?
    - If you answered yes to all the above questions, you‚Äôre done!

> üéØ Step 8 complete: YOU‚ÄôRE DONE WITH VERSION 5! You‚Äôve now built a full-stack application from start to finish, and deployed it remotely! Pat yourself on the back for all your hard work! üéâ

---

## Troubleshooting

- You can use Postman to troubleshoot your Render API endpoints if you are getting errors.
- The Logs section of Render will show you the console.logs or any error messages in your backend
- If you are having an issue with the Node server receiving the ‚Äòbody‚Äô of your API call, try adding NODE_VERSION 21.1.0 in the Environmental Variable in the Render dashboard. This will also require you to add ‚Äútype‚Äù: ‚Äúmodules‚Äù in your package.json and update all of your modules to ES modules. Then redeploy to Github.
- If you deploy your version-5 to Netlify, and get an error message when you open the deployment link that says *Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of ‚Äúapplication/octet-stream‚Äù. Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec*, this probably has something to do with your deploy settings in Netlify.
    - In the project's deploy settings on Netlify, change the Publish Directory to `version-5/dist` and the Build Command to `npm run build`. Then re-deploy and test your site again.
- Are you getting a 502 Bad Gateway error?
    - Make sure you have a `_redirects` file.
    - Make sure your web server has the correct Environment Variables. Compare the web server‚Äôs Environment Variables to your database server‚Äôs configuration keys (Which you can find under it‚Äôs Info tab under the Connections section.)
